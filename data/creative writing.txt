The rain had not stopped for three days, and the little town by the river seemed suspended in a gray dream. Streets glistened under dim lamplight, puddles merging into mirrors that reflected blurred outlines of trees and houses.

Amelia sat by the window, sketching in her worn notebook. The rain was her companion, steady and unyielding, a rhythm that seemed to echo her thoughts. She wasn’t drawing anything in particular—just shapes, patterns, lines that twisted and curved into strange landscapes.

Suddenly, she noticed a figure across the street: a boy, maybe her age, standing in the rain without an umbrella. He looked up at the same window where Amelia sat. For a brief moment, their eyes met, and she felt something stir—curiosity, perhaps, or recognition.

The boy smiled faintly before disappearing into the fog. Amelia closed her notebook and pressed her hand against the glass. She wondered if she had imagined him. Yet, the faint ripples in the puddle where he had stood told her otherwise.

For the first time in weeks, Amelia felt the rain was not just a burden but an invitation—to step outside, to explore, to discover stories waiting in the downpour.
