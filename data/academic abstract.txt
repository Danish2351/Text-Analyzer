This paper presents an investigation into the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing online job postings to identify emerging skill trends in the technology sector. A dataset of over 50,000 postings was collected from major recruitment platforms, and a keyword extraction model was applied to highlight recurring skills, programming languages, and certifications. Results indicate a steady rise in demand for cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Azure, alongside growing interest in machine learning frameworks, particularly TensorFlow and PyTorch. Surprisingly, classical programming languages like C and C++ continue to hold relevance, particularly in embedded systems and high-performance computing roles. By applying trend analysis across a five-year period, the study reveals the accelerating importance of data science and artificial intelligence expertise in diverse industries. The findings contribute to workforce development research and may inform policymakers, educators, and industry stakeholders seeking to align academic curricula with labor market needs. Future work will explore fine-grained skill taxonomies and region-specific analyses.
