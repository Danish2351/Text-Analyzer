# üìù Text Analysis Tool

This project is part of the **Buildables AI Fellowship - Week 1 Assignment**.  
The goal was to build a **Text Analysis Tool** in Python that demonstrates understanding of **LLMs, tokenization, and API usage**, with a simple **Streamlit interface**.

## üöÄ Features

- **Text Summarization**  
  Uses **Gemini (2.5 Flash)** and **Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile)** APIs to generate summaries for input text.

- **Tokenizer Analysis**  
  - Hugging Face **GPT-2** tokenizer  
  - Hugging Face **BERT** tokenizer    
  Displays how different tokenizers split text into tokens and count them.

- **Cost Estimation**  
  Tracks token usage for the model and provides an **estimated cost** based on per-token pricing.
